 // Recursion is when  a function calls itself
 
 // why 
 // good way to simplify your solution
 // if you find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller versions of the same problem
 // recursion is useful

 /*
 
 College as a principal  how many student
Principal = total is prof A + prof B
 total number of prof A and prof B
 prof A  = teacherA + teacherB
 prof B = teacherC + teacherD

 // A few points 
 /*
 every recursive solution need base case  - a condition to terminate the recursion
 recursion maybe simplify but not always means faster solution
 recursion is hard to  understand
