Algorithm design techniques
    Brute Force - Simple and exhaustive technique that evaluates every possible outcome to find the best solution.
                Ex: Linear Search.
    Greedy - Choose the best option at the current time , without any consideration for the future.
                Ex: Dijkstra's algorithm , Prim's algorithm and kruskal's  algorithm.
    Divide and Conquer- Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems. Each sub-problem is then solved and partial
                        solution are recombined to determine the overall solution.
                Ex: Binary Search ,Quick Sort , Merge Sort, Tower of Hanoi
    Dynamic Programming-Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems.Break it down into smaller but overlapping sub problem.
                        Store the result and reuse it for the same sub-problem.This is called memorization and optimization
                        technique that improves the time complexity of your algorithm.
                Ex: Fibonacci numbers and climbing staircase
    BackTracking-generate all possible solution.Check if the solution satisfies all the given constrains and only then you proceed
                        with generating subsequent solutions.If the constraints are not satisfied, backtrack and go on a different path to find the solution.
                Ex: N-Queens problem
