A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges

A tree is a non-linear data structure , compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and
 queues which are linear data structure.

 In linear data structure , the time required to search is proportional to the size of
 the data set.

 Tree however, owning to the nonlinear nature allow quicker and easier access to the data

 A tree  will not contain any loops or cycles


 Tree usage 

    file systems for directory structure
    A family tree 
    An organization tree
    DOM 
    Chat bots
    Abstract syntax trees

Tree Terminology

                 A
                /|\
               B C D
              /\
             E F

    parent node
    child node
    root node // don't have parent node (A)

    E,F,C and D leaf nodes // node that don't have child
    (B,C,D) and E,F are siblings
    A is an ancestor of E
    Path (A,E) is A-B-E
    Distance A,E is 2 
    Degree of node is total number of child it has
    Degree (B) is 2 
    Degree of tree is 3 
    Depth of E is 2 
    Height of B is 1 
    Height of tree is 2
