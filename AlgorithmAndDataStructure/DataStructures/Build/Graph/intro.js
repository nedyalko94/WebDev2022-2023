Graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of a finite number of vertices 
(also called nodes ) connected by edges

Trees are a specific type of graph data structure

    type of Graph
        Directed Graph
            A graph in which the edges have a direction 
            Edges are usually represented by arrows pointing in the direction
            the graph can be traversed
        Undirected Graph
            A graph in which the edges are bidirectional
            The graph can be traversed in either direction
            The absence of an arrow tells us that the graphs is undirected

            other type
graph can have only vertices/node with no edges,
 multiple edges from one node , 
cycles in the graph , 
self loop at a node , 
disconnected node,
 graph may contain  vets on edges represent the const of travel


Graph Usage

Google maps - cities /roots

social media sites - user is consider as vertices/node link as edges
    facebook ,instagram ,linkedin all use graph
