Linked List 

     A link list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes

     Each node consists of a data value and a pointer that  points to the next node 

     The list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure

     Random access of elements is not feasible and accessing an element has linear time complexity

     The linked list data structure supports three main operations

     ! insertions - to add an element at the beginning , end or given index in the list

     ! deletion - to remove an item given its index or value 

     !Search - to find an element given its value


     Linked list usage 
     
        ? All application of both stacks and queues are applications of liked lists
